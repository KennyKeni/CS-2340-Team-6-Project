5. See "Settings Saved" confirmation

### For Recruiters

When viewing candidate search results:

- **Hidden fields** show as grayed out text: "_Hidden by candidate_" or "_Location hidden_"
- **Sections completely hidden** show: "_Skills hidden by candidate_" with an eye-slash icon
- **Partial visibility** (e.g., education shown but not GPA) shows available data with "GPA" badge missing
- **Contact information** disabled buttons show "Contact Hidden"

## Privacy Enforcement

Privacy settings are enforced at multiple levels:

1. **Template Level:** Conditional rendering based on privacy settings
2. **Query Level:** Invisible profiles filtered out from recruiter searches
3. **Display Level:** Hidden information replaced with privacy indicators
4. **Default Safe:** All new settings default to `True` (visible) for backward compatibility
