# Privacy Settings Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented profile privacy settings for applicants/job seekers, allowing them to control what information recruiters can see on their profiles.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Model (`ProfilePrivacySettings`)

**Location:** `applicant/models.py`

Created a new model with the following privacy controls:

- `visible_to_recruiters` - Hide profile from recruiter searches
- `show_email` - Control email visibility
- `show_phone` - Control phone number visibility
- `show_resume` - Control resume visibility
- `show_gpa` - Control GPA visibility in education records
- `show_current_employment` - Control current job status visibility
- `show_current_education` - Control current education status visibility

All settings default to `True` (visible) for backward compatibility.

### 2. User Interface

**Location:** `job_app/templates/applicant/view_profile.html`

Added a "Privacy Settings" section to the applicant profile view with:

- Toggle switches for each privacy setting
- Clear descriptions of what each setting controls
- Real-time AJAX updates (no page reload)
- Visual feedback when settings are saved
- Accessible via `/applicant/profile/view/`

### 3. Backend Logic

**Locations:** `applicant/views.py`, `recruiter/views.py`

#### Applicant Views:

- Updated `view_profile()` to:

  - Display privacy settings
  - Handle AJAX POST requests for settings updates
  - Auto-create privacy settings if they don't exist

- Updated `applicant_search()` API to:
  - Filter out hidden profiles for recruiters
  - Mask protected fields based on privacy settings
  - Show full data to other applicants

#### Recruiter Views:

- Updated `candidate_search()` to:
  - Filter out profiles with `visible_to_recruiters=False`
  - Load privacy settings for remaining candidates

### 4. Template Updates

**Location:** `recruiter/templates/recruiter/candidate_search.html`

- Added applicant_utils template tags
- Conditionally display/hide protected information:
  - Resume buttons disabled when hidden
  - Contact buttons disabled when email is hidden
  - Current employment status badges respect privacy settings
- Clear indicators when information is hidden by candidate

### 5. Template Filters

**Location:** `applicant/templatetags/applicant_utils.py`

Added `get_privacy_setting` filter for safe privacy setting access with defaults.

### 6. Admin Interface

**Location:** `applicant/admin.py`

Added admin panel for `ProfilePrivacySettings` with:

- List display of key privacy flags
- Search by applicant username/email
- Filtering by privacy settings

### 7. Comprehensive Tests

**Location:** `applicant/tests.py`

Created 7 test cases covering:

- ✅ Privacy settings creation with defaults
- ✅ Profile view includes privacy settings
- ✅ AJAX updates to privacy settings
- ✅ Hidden profiles excluded from recruiter searches
- ✅ Visible profiles appear in recruiter searches
- ✅ API respects privacy for recruiters
- ✅ API shows full data to other applicants

All tests pass successfully!

### 8. Database Migrations

**Location:** `applicant/migrations/0001_initial.py`, `recruiter/migrations/0001_initial.py`

- Created and applied migrations for new ProfilePrivacySettings model
- Created and applied migrations for Recruiter model (was missing)

## How It Works

### For Applicants:

1. Visit "My Profile" page
2. Scroll to "Privacy Settings" section
3. Toggle any setting on/off
4. Settings save automatically via AJAX
5. See "Settings Saved" confirmation

### For Recruiters:

1. Search for candidates as usual
2. Hidden profiles won't appear in search results
3. For visible profiles with privacy settings:
   - Hidden fields show as "[Hidden]" or disabled buttons
   - Current status badges may show "Status Hidden"
   - Clear indicators when information is protected

## API Behavior

The `/applicant/search/` endpoint now:

- Checks if the requester is a recruiter
- Filters out invisible profiles for recruiters
- Masks protected fields based on privacy settings
- Returns full data to other applicants (not restricted)

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing profiles without privacy settings are treated as fully visible (all defaults to `True`)
- Template filter safely handles missing privacy settings
- Auto-creation of privacy settings when profile is accessed

## Files Changed/Created

### Created:

- `PRIVACY_SETTINGS_FEATURE.md` - Feature documentation
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file
- `applicant/migrations/0001_initial.py` - Database migration
- `recruiter/migrations/0001_initial.py` - Recruiter migration

### Modified:

- `applicant/models.py` - Added ProfilePrivacySettings model
- `applicant/views.py` - Added privacy handling in views
- `applicant/admin.py` - Added privacy settings admin
- `applicant/tests.py` - Added comprehensive test suite
- `applicant/templatetags/applicant_utils.py` - Added privacy filter
- `recruiter/views.py` - Added privacy filtering for recruiters
- `job_app/templates/applicant/view_profile.html` - Added privacy UI
- `recruiter/templates/recruiter/candidate_search.html` - Added privacy conditionals

## Testing

Run tests with:

```bash
uv run python manage.py test applicant.tests.ProfilePrivacySettingsTestCase
```

All 7 tests pass successfully!

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add privacy settings to applicant profile creation/edit flow
2. Implement profile view analytics (who viewed my profile)
3. Add temporary visibility options (e.g., visible for 30 days)
4. Create privacy presets ("Maximum Privacy", "Fully Open")
5. Add privacy settings for individual work experiences
6. Email notifications when privacy settings change
7. Privacy audit log for compliance

## Security Considerations

- Privacy settings are enforced at the database query level (not just UI)
- AJAX requests require authentication and use CSRF protection
- Privacy checks are performed in both template rendering and API responses
- Default-safe approach (privacy settings default to visible if missing)

## Performance Impact

- Minimal impact: Added `select_related('privacy_settings')` to queryset
- Privacy filtering uses database-level queries (efficient)
- AJAX updates don't require page reload
- Template filters cached for performance

## Compliance & Privacy

This feature helps with:

- GDPR compliance (user control over personal data)
- Professional networking etiquette
- Job seeker privacy concerns
- Selective information disclosure

## Success Metrics

To measure success of this feature:

- % of applicants who customize privacy settings
- Most commonly hidden fields
- Impact on recruiter engagement rates
- User feedback on privacy controls
- Support tickets related to privacy concerns
